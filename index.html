		<h2>British Sign Language (BSL)</h2>

		<p>Taking up sign language on the side first started as i aimed to complete my bronze and silver interantional award of Edingburgh. However, over these past months i have taken a specfic liking to it, especially as it involves me using hand movements rather than words to express - which was contrasting in comparison to my years of learning french which i found relatively difficult, especially when it came to confidently speaking and pronouncing. When starting to learn, i thought it was perfect, coonsidering i got to avoid my struggle of public speaking, especially in a different language.As  i progressed with different signs such as items, expressions, commonly used phrases and greetings,many of these signs had started to become muscle memory.I find this very fascinating as not only would i be using my hands to perform actual signs, but this was an actual whole language i was 'speaking'. </p>
